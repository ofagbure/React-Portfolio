## Description 

This is my Developer Profile. It is a place where prospective employees and fellow developers can get to know me better. As a novice in this field, I want to ensure that people know who I am, including my strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement/ potential. 

This profile page contains my personal information (background, interests, and a few more details about who I am), as well as a way for people to reach me, and examples of different projects I have worked on. As mentioned earlier, all are welcome to my page and I would be very happy to hear/ learn from you!


## About
 
The first page of this project is the "About" page. As mentioned earlier, this page contains some very basic information about me, my background, interests, and why I have decided to pursue an education in coding. There is also a profile picture to give a better idea of who I am. 

## Contact

The contact page is a place for visitors to my site to reach out to me for more information. I welcome any who would do so. Most importantly, I welcome any suggestions for improvement, and/or advise on how to continually learn and grow in this field as it is a very new one for me.


## Portfolio

This page includes some of the projects I have/ aim to work on. More information  will be added to this page as my protfolio grows in the coming weeks - months.
